                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Cathay Pacific Airways said today it is working with 27 regulators in 15 jurisdictions to investigate a data breach that affected millions of passengers, as Hong Kong lawmakers grilled executives over how it handled the incident.
<div>
</div><div>The executives did not answer repeated questions about whether the airline would compensate all affected customers or if it might face a hefty fine under new European Union privacy regulations, saying it was "too early" to comment, Reuters reports.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cathay has come under mounting criticism after it said late last month that about 9.4 million passengers' personal data had been accessed without authorization, seven months after it became aware of the breach.
</div><div>
</div><div>It was not immediately clear who was behind the breach or what the information might be used for, but Cathay said there was no evidence so far that personal information had been misused.
</div><div>
</div><div>"The incident is a crisis," Cathay chairman John Slosar told the committee. "It is the most serious one the airline has faced."
</div><div>
</div><div>Slosar again apologized for failing to protect customers' data and said he regretted that the company could not investigate the attack more quickly.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cathay said in a document submitted to the Legislative Council that it first detected suspicious activity on its network in March and that the attack continued in the following months and expanded in scope.
</div><div>
</div><div>The airline then took until mid-August to conclude which passenger data had been accessed, according to the document, and it completed the identification of the personal data that pertained to each individual passenger on October 24.
</div><div>
</div><div>Slosar said that in future Cathay would instantly disclose any similar issues to the authorities.
</div><div>
</div><div>The company denied the data breach was a result of layoffs at its IT department last year. Cathay said an airline restructuring had been completed and it planned to hire 1,800 staff this year.
</div><div>
</div><div>It also said it has spent over HK$1 billion on IT infrastructure and security over the past three years.</div></h3>

                <h2 class="align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2">Billionaire Bloomberg ponders presidential bid early next year</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Having spent a fortune to help elect Democrats this fall, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared lifetime allegiance to the Democratic Party and outlined an aggressive timeline for deciding whether to run for president.
<div>
</div><div>"I think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,” Bloomberg told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday.
</div><div>
</div><div>The 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects. He conceded that "it’s much too early to tell” whether he has a legitimate chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and, with it, the chance to take on another New York billionaire, President Donald Trump.
</div><div>
</div><div>"Thanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January — that’s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, ‘Look, do I have a chance?’ I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don’t know whether it’s possible,” Bloomberg told the AP.
</div><div>
</div><div>He added, "If people don’t seem to be warming to you, there’s plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it’s given my kids and me.”
</div><div>
</div><div>Should he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. Hardly a far-left liberal, he is described by his team as socially progressive and business-minded. He has spent tens of millions of dollars to promote liberal priorities on climate change, gun control and immigration.
</div><div>
</div><div>It’s unclear, however, whether there’s room for Bloomberg in today’s Democratic Party.
</div><div>
</div><div>Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a lukewarm assessment this week when asked about Bloomberg’s US$110 million investment in his party’s 2018 midterm efforts.
</div><div>
</div><div>"I applaud everybody who was involved,” Perez said in an interview. "Very appreciative of Mayor Bloomberg. Equally appreciative of those grassroots activists who were knocking on doors every weekend, texting people, investing 50 bucks in the Democratic Party.”
</div><div>
</div><div>Still, Bloomberg endeared himself to many Democratic leaders in recent months after deciding to invest more than US$110 million in the 2018 midterms — largely focused on House races. Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time.
</div><div>
</div><div>The decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren’t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said.
</div><div>
</div><div>"I will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,” Bloomberg said.
</div><div>
</div><div>Initially registered as a Democrat, the Massachusetts native filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. In June 2007, he unenrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October.
